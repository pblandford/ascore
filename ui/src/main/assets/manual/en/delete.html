<h2 id="deleting-events">Deleting events</h2>
<p>There are several ways to remove events.</p>
<h3 id="method-1">Method 1</h3>
<p>In input mode (ie, when the keyboard is showing), position the marker at the required segment and press the eraser button <img src="../resources/eraser.png" alt="icon" /></p>
<p>This will delete any chord at the marker and move the marker along one. If there is a rest at the marker, it will be merged with any neighbouring rest.</p>
<h3 id="method-2">Method 2</h3>
<p>Long press on the eraser button - this will put the app into a special delete mode, where any event you touch in the score will be removed.</p>

<h3 id="method-3---deleting-specific-event-types">Method 3 - deleting specific event types</h3>
<p>Navigate to the insert page for the event you want to delete, then press the eraser button - this will put the app into a special mode similar to the last method, except only events of the desired type will be deleted. This is useful when the events are very small, for example staccato marks.</p>

<h3 id="deleting-a-range-of-events">Deleting a range of events</h3>
<p>Long press in score to select the start of the range, then tap once to select the end. Then press the eraser button - this will remove all notes, and consolidate rests as far as possible. It will also remove other events such as lyrics, harmonies and dynamic marks - some events, such as time signatures and key signatures, are not affected.</p>

<h3 id="deleting-bars">Deleting Bars</h3>
<p>Long press in the score to select the first bar you want to delete, then tap to select the end of the range. Then <em>long-press</em> the delete button to remove all bars in the range.</p>
<h3 id="deleting-instruments">Deleting Instruments</h3>
<p>Navigate to the Insert Instrument page and press the delete button - this will turn gray, putting the app into its 'delete event' mode. Now any instrument you press on will be removed.</p>
