<h2 id="playback">Playback</h2>
<p>You can listen back to your score by pressing the playback button in the top right - to stop playback just press it again.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>You can pause the playback by long-pressing the playback button - when you press it again it will resume from the same position.</p>
<p>To start playback from a particular point in the score, long-press on the required segment, then press play.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>To listen to a selection, long-press to set the start of the selection, single-press to set the end, then press play.</p>
<p>While playback is in a progress, a special panel appears at the bottom of the screen, where various options can be selected:</p>

</div>
<p>The leftmost <img src="../resources/shuffle.png" alt="icon" /> button causes the score to be played in shuffle rhythm - ie simple eighth notes are played with a triplet feel.</p>
<p>The <img src="../resources/chord.png" alt="icon" /> button allows playback of harmonies. When this button is enabled, an instrument selector appears to its right allowing you to select the sound of the playback. (Note this button won't have any effect if there are no chord symbols to play!)</p>
<p>The <img src="../resources/loop.png" alt="icon" /> button allows looping of playback - if a range has been selected it will loop this section, otherwise it will keep playing the whole piece.</p>
<p>The rightmost <img src="../resources/mixer.png" alt="icon" /> button displays a simple mixer console, where the relative volumes of each instrument can be altered as the score is playing (the levels will be remembered after the score is reloaded).</p>
