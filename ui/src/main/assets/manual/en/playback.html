<h2 id="playback">Playback</h2>
<p>You can listen back to your score by pressing the playback button in the top right - to stop playback just press it again.</p>

</div>
<p>You can pause the playback by long-pressing the playback button - when you press it again it will resume from the same position.</p>
<p>To start playback from a particular point in the score, long-press on the required segment, then press play.</p>

</div>
<p>To listen to a selection, long-press to set the start of the selection, single-press to set the end, then press play.</p>

<p>The mixer button brings up a mixer console, where the volumes of the various instruments can be altered, and muted or soloed:</p>

</div>

<p>There is also a panel of options to affect the playback</p>
<p>The leftmost <img src="../resources/shuffle.png" alt="icon" /> button causes the score to be played in shuffle rhythm - ie simple eighth notes are played with a triplet feel.</p>
<p>The <img src="../resources/chord.png" alt="icon" /> button allows playback of harmonies. When this button is long-pressed, an instrument selector appears to its right allowing you to select the sound of the playback. (Note this button won't have any effect if there are no chord symbols to play!)</p>
<p>The <img src="../resources/loop.png" alt="icon" /> button allows looping of playback - if a range has been selected it will loop this section, otherwise it will keep playing the whole piece.</p>
